# Decoding Cancer: A Machine Learning  Approach to Gene Expression Analysis
The early detection and classificaƟon of cancer types play a crucial role in treatment planning and improving the survival rate. In recent years, gene expression profiling has been used to classify cancer types accurately. In this project for stat437 (High Dimensional Data Learning), we aim to classify different cancer types using gene expression profiling data obtained from RNA-Seq (Human Cancer dataset-The Cancer Genome Atlas ).

We will be using two data files for our analysis in the project such as ‘labels.csv’ and ‘data.csv’. The file “labels.csv” contains the cancer type for each sample, and “data.csv” that contains the “gene expression profile” (i.e., expression measurements of a set of genes) for each sample. The project answers range of questions under two broad tasks:
1) Task A: Clustering
2) Task B: Classification

Our goal is to apply K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Nearest-Neighbor Classifier and Discriminant Analysis for classificaƟon to identify the cancer type of each subject accurately.
